En Passant
Pawn promotion
Check that castling can only be done once

Maybe some day:
 *Add in some function that prevents you from making a move if it would
  place you in check. This isn't too important as far as gameplay goes.
 *get_all_origins() shouldn't have move/board checking like it does for
  doing pawn moves. Eventually I'd like get_single_origin() to do all that
  work while get_all_origins() just gets all possible origins for that piece.
