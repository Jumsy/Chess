En Passant
  En passant has mostly been added in. The value self.en_passant in
  the class Chess needs to be taken out the next turn so that pawns 
  can't still capture to that empty square later
Pawn promotion
Check that castling can only be done once

Maybe some day:
 *Add in some function that prevents you from making a move if it would
  place you in check. This isn't too important as far as gameplay goes.
 *get_all_origins() shouldn't have move/board checking like it does for
  doing pawn moves. Eventually I'd like get_single_origin() to do all that
  work while get_all_origins() just gets all possible origins for that piece.
