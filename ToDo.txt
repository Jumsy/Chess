En Passant
Pawn promotion
Check that castling can only be done once
Collision Checking:
 Right now if one pawn is in front of another pawn on 
 the home row, the pawn in back prevents the other from
 moving.

Maybe some day:
 Add in some function that prevents you from making a move if it would
 place you in check. This isn't too important as far as gameplay goes.
