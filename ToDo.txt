Check that castling can only be done once
The rook needs to be moved along with the king when castling.
Collision Checking.
  Right now if one pawn is in front of another pawn on 
 the home row, the pawn in back prevents the other from
 moving.
  Also, if a bishop, rook, or queen won't check if any
 pieces are in between the origin and the target. This
 can hang up another piece's legitimate move similar to
 the pawn, or let the bishop, rook, or queen move wrongly.
